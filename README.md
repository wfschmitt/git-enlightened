# git-enlightened
ONEXENIUS is a neat Enlightenment build script for Ubuntu users.

This script allows you to safely and easily download, install, update the GIT
master version of Enlightenment 0.22 (aka E22) on Ubuntu Xenial Xerus
and Zesty Zapus; or helps you perform a clean uninstall of E22 GIT.

The installation instructions are contained in the script itself.

**Getting started**

Click the "Clone or download" green button.

```
